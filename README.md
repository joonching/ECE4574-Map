# Assignment 0 - A* with flexibility

Submitted by: **Joshua Chung**
## User Stories

The following are **required** functionalities for map:
* [x] The map has to be generated before the pathfinding begins
* [x] Weight restriction is at 1000 for non-connected nodes and 50 for obstacle nodes
* [x] Using a Matrix Adjacency for nodes. Therefore, graph format is required for both A* and MAP
* [x] Memory space for the matrix depending on the scale of the real-world map
* [x] Using a new map requires the input of new h-vals for the new nodes

The following are **additional** features that need to be implemented:
* [x] self-generating h-val (i.e. using the Manhattan)
